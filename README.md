What is particle motion? How do particles move? This question has puzzled humanity. Humans have been conducting relentless research on it. "Force," "inertia," "direction," "velocity," and more are all concepts generated by humans for the study of particle motion. However, humans still cannot describe with clarity, accuracy, completeness, or correctness how particles actually move. Moreover, this has given rise to some paradoxes and controversies. All of this stems from the fact that humans have not yet truly understood the nature of particle motion.
